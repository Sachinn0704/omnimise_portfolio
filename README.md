## 🎯 Why I’m a Fit for Omnimise (Backend Role)

Omnimise is building trusted, fraud-free career identities; that needs **secure systems, strong backend APIs, and data integrity.**  

I bring:  

- Experience with **Python-based backends (Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit)** and model deployment.  
- Projects focused on **security, identity, and reliability** (blockchain voting, face recognition, steganography).  
- Solid **data skills (SQL, Pandas, NumPy)** to work with candidate profiles, analytics, and verification pipelines. 
- Comfort with **cloud and dev tools** (AWS/GCP basics, Git/GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter/Colab) for modern backend workflows. 

For Omnimise, I want to build **robust APIs and services** that handle identity verification, fraud detection, and trustworthy data flows at scale.

## 💻 Backend & Systems Projects

### 1️⃣ Blockchain Smart Election Voting System  
**Tech:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Web3.py, OpenCV [file:92]  

- Built a **secure and transparent voting system** with **face recognition** to verify voters, which is directly relevant to **identity verification and fraud prevention**, similar to Omnimise’s mission. [file:92]  
- Recorded votes on **blockchain** to make them immutable and tamper-proof, ensuring **trust, auditability, and accuracy**. 

> What this shows for Omnimise:  
> - Handling **sensitive identity data** securely.  
> - Designing **tamper-resistant systems** and thinking about **trust** as a core requirement.
