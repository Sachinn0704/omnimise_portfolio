# 🗳 Blockchain Smart Election Voting System with Face Recognition
**Tech:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Web3.py, OpenCV  
A secure and transparent voting system that combines **face recognition–based voter verification** with **blockchain technology** to prevent fraud and ensure vote integrity.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **smart electronic voting system** where voters are authenticated using **facial recognition**, and votes are recorded on a **blockchain ledger**.
The goal is to eliminate common issues in traditional voting systems such as **duplicate voting, identity fraud, and vote tampering**, while maintaining transparency and auditability.

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🔐 **Face-Based Voter Authentication:**  
  Uses computer vision techniques to verify voter identity before allowing a vote.

- ⛓ **Blockchain-Based Vote Storage:**  
  Votes are stored on a blockchain to ensure **immutability and tamper resistance**.

- 🛡 **Fraud Prevention:**  
  Prevents duplicate or unauthorized voting attempts through identity verification.

- 📊 **Auditability & Transparency:**  
  Every vote can be verified without revealing voter identity.

## 🏗 System Workflow

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Capture voter image through camera  
2. Perform face detection and recognition  
3. Verify voter eligibility  
4. Record vote as a blockchain transaction  
5. Store transaction hash for audit purposes  
## 📈 Results & Observations

**Observed Outcomes:**
- Accurate voter verification during test runs  
- Immutable vote storage using blockchain  
- No duplicate voting allowed after identity verification  
- Transparent and traceable voting records  

## 🔍 Backend & Security Relevance

This project demonstrates:
- Secure handling of **identity-related data**
- Integration of **AI modules with backend systems**
- Designing **tamper-resistant data pipelines**
- Strong understanding of **trust and verification mechanisms**

These concepts directly apply to **backend services dealing with identity, security, and fraud prevention**.
