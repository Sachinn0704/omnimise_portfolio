## 🎯 Why I’m a Fit for Omnimise (Backend Role)

Omnimise is building trusted, fraud-free career identities; that needs **secure systems, strong backend APIs, and data integrity.**  

I bring:  

- Experience with **Python-based backends (Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit)** and model deployment.  
- Projects focused on **security, identity, and reliability** (blockchain voting, face recognition, steganography).  
- Solid **data skills (SQL, Pandas, NumPy)** to work with candidate profiles, analytics, and verification pipelines. 
- Comfort with **cloud and dev tools** (AWS/GCP basics, Git/GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter/Colab) for modern backend workflows. 

For Omnimise, I want to build **robust APIs and services** that handle identity verification, fraud detection, and trustworthy data flows at scale.

# 🔐 Phase Encoding & Error Correction Code (ECC) Steganography System

**Tech:** Python, NumPy, OpenCV / PIL, bitarray, Matplotlib  

A security-focused system designed to hide sensitive data inside images while
maintaining data integrity using Error Correction Codes (ECC).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements phase encoding–based image steganography combined with
Error Correction Codes (ECC) to securely embed and recover confidential data
from digital images.

The system is robust against noise and transmission errors, making it suitable
for secure backend and data-protection use cases.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🔒 Secure data hiding using phase encoding  
- 🛡 Error detection and correction using ECC  
- 📊 High data recovery accuracy under noisy conditions  
- ⚙️ Algorithm-focused, defensive implementation  

---

## 🏗 System Workflow

![System Workflow](images/workflow.png)

**Steps:**
1. Input secret text  
2. Apply ECC encoding  
3. Embed data using phase encoding  
4. Transmit/store image  
5. Decode phase information  
6. Apply ECC decoding to recover data
