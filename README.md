## 🎯 Why I’m a Fit for Omnimise (Backend Role)

Omnimise is building trusted, fraud-free career identities; that needs **secure systems, strong backend APIs, and data integrity.**  

I bring:  

- Experience with **Python-based backends (Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit)** and model deployment. [file:92]  
- Projects focused on **security, identity, and reliability** (blockchain voting, face recognition, steganography). [file:92]  
- Solid **data skills (SQL, Pandas, NumPy)** to work with candidate profiles, analytics, and verification pipelines. [file:92]  
- Comfort with **cloud and dev tools** (AWS/GCP basics, Git/GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter/Colab) for modern backend workflows. [file:92]  

For Omnimise, I want to build **robust APIs and services** that handle identity verification, fraud detection, and trustworthy data flows at scale.
